//2: write wasdom ESP32 operating algorithm:

//First, make sure the piece is working by link and the led on the piece is on and off.
//Second, download Arduino IDE and connect the piece to the device and download the identification.
//Third, run the program.

//The piece needs WiFi and is interested in audio coding.

//forth, first go to file and then go to examples and then blink.

//We use this code to make sure that the piece is working correctly and programmed correctly.

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup(){
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  //get information from INPUT or giving information to OUTPUT.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop(){
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);
  // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);
  // wait for a second
}

//digitalWrite takes two parameters and sends information from the program to the board.

//LED_BUILTIN is the LED on the board, you could use a number to tell it which digital Output to write to.

//HIGH is equal to ON or 1.
//LOW is equal to OFF or 0 (no electricity).
//The delay takes one parameter - the number of milliseconds (one thousand of a second).

//From tools, then a port, then we choose the port to make sure that the code has moved to the electronic chip.
